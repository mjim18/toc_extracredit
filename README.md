I created a test for my Neural Turing Machine (NTM) project to ensure the model was functioning as expected. Specifically, I designed a CSV test file with inputs and corresponding outputs that I knew correlated with machines I've designed on homework. This allowed me to thoroughly evaluate the machine's performance against a known baseline. I chose to focus on this aspect because I struggled to fully understand how the NTM worked when using code to implement it. The underlying mechanics, especially how the machine processed and stored data, felt unfamiliar when only reviewing the implementation. I realized that without a clear understanding of the model's functionality, I would have difficulty debugging or interpreting the results. By manually creating the test file and working through the expected outputs by hand, I gained a deeper understanding of how the NTM reads, writes, and updates memory. Identifying discrepancies between the expected and actual outputs gave insights into where potential errors might occur in the model or its training process. The process helped me see why the metrics of steps to accept, tree depth, and determinism are meaningful indicators of the model's functionality and efficiency. The equal_par.csv is the test file.
I created this file after using the test files provided by the drive file and modeled it after the format.
